# Pentesting Laboratory

Local docker Environment for testing und playing.

## Features
<WORK IN PROGRESS>

- <placeholder>


## Install requirements (only for Windows WSL)
For Windows you need to install WSL first. I recommend to user Ubuntu WSL.

Powershell
```bash
    wsl --install
    wsl --install -d Ubuntu
```

## Run project
You have to run the script as root. You can use 'sudo' or login as 'root'.

!! NOTE: This script has only been tested with the package managers 'apt' and 'pacman' so far. Although it should theoretically work with other supported package managers, this has not yet been verified.

/bin/bash
```bash
   chmod +x ./setup
   sudo ./setup
```
