# Test Laboratory
Local docker Environment for testing und playing.

## Network
The local network is a Class C network. Since all containers are in the same network and should be able to see each other, subnetting is not an issue.

However, if you want to work with subnetting, it is necessary to switch to a Class B network. It also works with a Class C network, but in my opinion, it makes little sense, and the possibilities are greater with a Class B network.
